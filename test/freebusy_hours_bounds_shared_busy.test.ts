/**
 * A free/busy grant's `hours` bounds what the peer is told, not only what the console suggests.
 *
 * `calendar.freebusy.read` is the one capability whose implementation reads the grant's `scope`: the query is
 * bounded by `window_days` and by the grantor's daily `hours`. The response already obeyed `window_days` — `window`
 * narrowed to the granted span and anything past it treated as unknown — but the peer's `busy` array was passed
 * through whole, so the other side could read a block at 02:00–03:00 and a block from 08:00–09:30 that crosses the
 * window, while `common_free_suggestions` in the same answer stayed inside 09:00–18:00. One scope field bounded the
 * answer, the other only the suggestions.
 *
 * Each busy block is now cut to the grantor's local `hours`: a block wholly outside is dropped, a crossing block is
 * truncated at the boundary. Dropping a crossing block instead would tell the peer its inside part is free, which is
 * not true; truncating it keeps the part of the block that the grant actually shares. The cut is a daily window
 * only, with no weekday rule (the Monday–Friday filter belongs to the suggestion heuristic, not to the scope), and
 * an `hours` window that ends before it starts shares no busy at all.
