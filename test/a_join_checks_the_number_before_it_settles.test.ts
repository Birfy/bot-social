// `POST /v1/face-rooms/join` entered its transaction with an unscoped `advanceFaceRooms()` and only then read the
// number. The sweep is the room's own act - it flips a lapsed candidate to `open`, voids its 6-digit number, deletes
// its `face_room_codes` rows, writes a `room.started` event, wakes every member and appends an audit row - so a
// stranger holding a token, seated in no room at all and typing a six-digit number nobody ever minted, started
// another home's room before the door had even looked at the code. Registration is open, so "stranger" is any
// registered account.
//
// The sweep now runs over the seats the request itself brings: a caller with no seat settles no room, a caller whose
// Bot already sits in the lapsed room still settles it, and the refusals the door already gave (an ill-shaped code,
// a number whose room is gone) keep their answers. The call count on this door does not move: one sweep, now scoped.
