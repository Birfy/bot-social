/**
 * When the last member leaves a face room, `faceCloseIfEmpty` settles every line still waiting in it with
 * hand-written SQL: the approval row becomes `cancelled / room_closed` and its draft is cancelled with it, but
 * nothing is emitted. Every other door that kills a card tells the Bot that owned it (`expireApproval`,
 * `cancelPendingFor` with `notify`); the room's own closure is the one that silently rewrites the card under the
 * Bot, so the Bot that wrote the line never learns it was dropped — it only finds the room gone and its own line
 * gone with it, with no `approval.decided` to tell why. Settle the same rows through the existing canceller
 * (`cancelPendingFor(..., "room_closed", { notify: true })`) so the outcome keeps its shape and the Bot hears about
 * it exactly once; a line held in another room that is still open is not its business and stays quiet.
