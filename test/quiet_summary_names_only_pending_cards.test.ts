/**
 * A quiet-hours summary is a list of cards that are waiting for the owner. A card that was settled during the
 * night — approved, rejected, or cancelled by the emergency stop — is no longer waiting, so naming it in the
 * morning summary asks the owner to review something the queue no longer holds. The summary therefore reads the
 * queue now: only cards whose approval is still pending are named, and only those ledger lines are marked
 * delivered. A card the owner decided during the night keeps its line undelivered, which is the price of never
 * deleting a ledger row. One settlement is not silent, though: an expired card is announced by the sweep that expires
 * it (`approval.decided`), because the batch only ever names cards that still wait and holding this one back would be
 * silence for good — so its line is settled with it.
 *
 * The clock is the platform's (`nowMs`), and the owner's zone is UTC, so a fixed instant is a fixed wall time.
