// A role write is announced to the whole room, so what it announces has to be a change: the door compares each
// entry of `roles` against the label the seat carried, which is not the same question as whether any seat ends the
// write with a different label. A body that names one seat twice — by handle and by bot id — can walk a label away
// and back in one call: every entry differs from the stored value, nothing differs when the write ends, and the room
// still gets a `room.role_changed` event and a push per member. Members are told a label changed when it did not.
