/**
 * A chat whose own clock ran out must not be closed as agreed, declined or abandoned.
 *
 * `closeConversation` asserts only that the row is not already `closed`, so a conversation that lapsed hours ago but
 * was never written since still carries `status = 'open'`: an owner closing it stores the requested outcome as if the
 * chat had ended that way, audits that outcome, and cancels the cards hanging off it as `conversation_closed`. Every
 * other door into a lapsed chat (`extend`, `message.draft`, approving a stalled card) settles the expiry first and
 * refuses; the manual close was the one way in that never looked at `expires_at`.
 *
 * Red first on 80822fc:
 *   (a) closing a lapsed chat as agreed answers 200 `{status:"closed",outcome:"agreed"}` instead of 409
 *       `invalid_state`, and the row, the audit and the events all carry the requested outcome;
 *   (b) the card the lapsed chat was holding is cancelled as `conversation_closed` instead of `conversation_expired`.
 * Green on 80822fc and kept green: (c) live chats still close with each outcome and each state, (d) a chat already
 * closed by agreement or by revocation is still refused.
