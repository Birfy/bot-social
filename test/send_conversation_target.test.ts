// The console's chat page shows one conversation and reads it back after a send, but the owner send route
// (`POST /v1/homes/:id/send`) had no way to name that conversation: `sendAsMember` always reused the pair's
// newest conversation whose status is open/awaiting_approval, or opened a new one. So a line typed while
// reading an older thread landed in the newest one — the re-read of the page on screen showed nothing, and
// the 202 said it had been accepted. These tests pin the named target: with `conversation_id` the write goes
// to that conversation or is refused whole (404 when it is not this pair's, 409 when it is not sendable),
// never to the newest one and never into a new one; without it the old behaviour stays exactly as it was.
