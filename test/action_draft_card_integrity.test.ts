// An action draft is a card the owner decides. `draftAction` writes the approval card and the `actions` row, and the
// card reader (`approvalCard`) dereferences the action row unconditionally. Nothing type-checks the free-form fields
// the Bot sends (`justification`, and the `params` values execution later reads, such as `title` or `booking_id`), so a
// value that SQLite cannot bind makes the write throw after the card exists: a 500, an approval row whose subject row
// was never written, and a pending list that 500s for every card the owner owns until the orphan leaves it. The same
// unchecked values arrive through the owner's edit door, which merges them into the params execution writes.
